Research
----------
I’m a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the Human-Centered Computing group at the University of Colorado [Sikuli lab](http://lab.sikuli.org/). I’m broadly interested in the intersection of Human-Centered Computing, User Interface Software and Technology, and Software Engineering. I’m especially interested in designing and building systems that identify the inconsistency between mobile User Interfaces (UIs) and the underlying application behaviors to detect serious security threats. I’ve also worked on visual automation tools, making them accessible to all users with little to no programming experience.


Education
-----------
I attained a B.Sc. in Computer Science from King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia in 2007. In 2012, I acompleted my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.
