I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder,
where I work with [Tom Yeh](http://tomyeh.info) at the [Sikuli lab](http://lab.sikuli.org).
My research combines technical approaches from the areas of human-computer interaction, software engineering, and information retrieval.
In particular, I apply data driven approaches to study various aspects of mobile applications over time.
I am especially interested in developing novel retrieval systems for mobile applications to support diverse types of data analyses.
