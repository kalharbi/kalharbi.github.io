I'm an assistant professor of Computer Science at King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I worked with Prof. Tom Yeh in the Sikuli lab. My research combines technical approaches from the areas of human-computer interaction, software engineering, and data science. In particular, I apply data-driven approaches to study various aspects of user interfaces over time. I am especially interested in designing and building large-scale data systems to support diverse types of data analyses.
