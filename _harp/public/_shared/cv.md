# Khalid Alharbi
Computer Science PhD Candidate in the area of human-centered computing (HCC).
Expected graduation: August-September 2016.
## Summary
I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I work with [Tom Yeh](http://tomyeh.info) in the [Sikuli lab](http://lab.sikuli.org). My research combines technical approaches from the areas of human-computer interaction, software engineering, and information retrieval. In particular, I apply data-driven approaches to study various aspects of mobile applications over time. I am especially interested in developing large-scale retrieval systems for mobile applications to support diverse types of data analyses.
